# 👗 Modern Virtual Trial Room Using AI and VR Technology

This project is a smart virtual trial room that uses **Artificial Intelligence**, **Augmented Reality (AR)**, and **Virtual Reality (VR)** to allow users to **try on clothes and accessories virtually** — just like in a real store. It enhances online shopping by making it **more interactive, personalized, and accurate**.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

Traditional online shopping lacks the ability to try clothes before buying, causing **high return rates and poor customer experience**. Our project solves this using:

- Real-time body tracking
- 3D garment overlay
- AI-powered recommendations
- Virtual fitting experience using AR/VR

---

## 💡 Key Features

- 👤 Real-time face & body tracking (using MediaPipe/OpenCV)
- 👓 Try-on support for items like goggles, necklaces, frocks, etc.
- 🎯 AI-driven personalized product recommendations
- 🛒 Option to directly add items to cart after virtual try-on
- ⚡ Fast, intuitive UI with cross-platform support
